Project Aries
=============

Project Aries aims to create a deployable, personal journaling system that is easily accessed across network devices.

TODO:
 -  document the project structure so we don't have to troubleshoot next time.  We created a workspace, added a pydev project in /src, created a general project for docs and then linked in readme.me and setup.py.
 -  set up the python projects for the /aries /tests and /bin folders and document that structure and its use.
