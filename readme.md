Project Aries
=============

Project Aries aims to create a deployable, personal journaling system that is easily accessed across network devices.

## Abstract

Aries is a strain of Project[0] that creates a python package to provide the ability to create a personal journal.  This journal allows the user to restore any document using an abstraction of Git's version control.  Documents are organized, not by path, but by tag hierarchy.  However, users have the option to 'publish' documents which allows for relationships, contextual edits, etc.  The purpose is to encourage freewriting initially and then to provide tools to assist in the organization of those thoughts.

The project is built to respond to three orders of recursion: 1) it generates a python package that can be easily installed as a component for future projects (a Project[0] virus) 2) it generates a functional package as an executable that implements the python package (a Project[0] carrier) and 3) it prototypes an early form of a pattern to drive (a Project[0] delivery method).
